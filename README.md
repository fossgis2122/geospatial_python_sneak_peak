# Geospatial Python Sneak Peak

This repository gives a brief demonstration of how to perform geospatial analysis using Python, openrouteservice and ohsome API. It is a classic site selection analysis to find a suitable apartment.

To get started right away without setting up the Python environment on your computer, you can rund the analysis on [myBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fossgis2122/geospatial_python_sneak_peak/HEAD?labpath=apartment_search.ipynb). Just click the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fossgis2122/geospatial_python_sneak_peak/HEAD?labpath=apartment_search.ipynb) button.
