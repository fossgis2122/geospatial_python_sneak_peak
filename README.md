# Geospatial Python Sneak Peak

This repository gives a brief demonstration of how to perform geospatial analysis using Python. It is a classic site selection analysis to find a suitable apartment. Apart from Python it is making use of openrouteservice and ohsome API. 



You can rund the analysis on a server from [myBinder.org]() so you don't have to set up the Python envrionment on your own computer. But if you'd like to, of course you can. 

## Installation 

Create a new python environment and install the required packages. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Start `jupyter notebook` and open the notebook `apartment_search.ipynb`. You can just scroll through the notebook and read the comments or execute each cell one by one to understand what is being done. Play around with the variables in the cells which are marked with **Exercise**.
